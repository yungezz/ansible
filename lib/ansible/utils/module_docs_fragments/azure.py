notes:
    - For authentication with Azure you can pass parameters, set environment variables, use a profile stored
      in C(~/.azure/credentials) or login with Azure CLI.
      Authentication is possible using a service principal or Active Directory user.
      To authenticate via service principal, pass C(subscription_id), C(client_id), C(secret) and C(tenant) or set environment
      variables C(AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID), C(AZURE_CLIENT_ID), C(AZURE_SECRET) and C(AZURE_TENANT).
    - To authenticate via Active Directory user, pass C(ad_user) and C(password), or set C(AZURE_AD_USER) and
      C(AZURE_PASSWORD) in the environment.
    - "Alternatively, credentials can be stored in C(~/.azure/credentials). This is an ini file containing
      a [default] section and the following keys: C(subscription_id), C(client_id), C(secret) and C(tenant) or
      C(subscription_id), C(ad_user) and C(password). It is also possible to add additional profiles. Specify the profile
      by passing profile or setting C(AZURE_PROFILE) in the environment."
    - Use 'az login' to login with Azure CLI. Set the I(cli_default_profile) flag to C(true) in the playbook, the azure resource module
      can use Azure CLI credentials.
